## 1. Scope of Service

During this Free Phase, I may build you:

- A simple game using Java + libGDX
- A lightweight Android app (Kotlin + Jetpack)
- A static or portfolio-style website

Projects are chosen based on feasibility, relevance to my skills, and current workload. I reserve the right to accept or decline requests.



## 2. Ownership & Rights

You retain full ownership of your project idea and final deliverables.

However, I reserve the right to:

- Showcase the work in my personal portfolio (e.g., datsforge.com, GitHub, etc.)
- Reference it publicly unless we both agree in writing not to




## 3. Testimonials

In return for a free or discounted build, you agree to provide a **truthful testimonial**.

You grant datsforge the right to publish:

- Your testimonial
- Your name (first name or alias)
- Your photo
- A link to your profile or website (if relevant)

This is for credibility purposes and helps support future offerings.

Please understand this is an experimental, goodwill-based offering. That means:

- No guaranteed delivery timeline
- No included ongoing support or updates
- No custom feature requests beyond the initial scope
- Rude or abusive behavior will result in immediate rejection or termination




## 5. Disclaimer

This service is offered *as-is*. I make no guarantees regarding:

- Fitness for any particular purpose

You assume full responsibility for how the deliverable is used or deployed.




## 6. Changes to These Terms
