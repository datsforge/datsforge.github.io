            <h1>Hey there!</h1>
            <p> Game development, pixel art? Isn't it a perfect combo? -tell me we got something in common there!</p>
            <p> I'm a seasoned Java game developer specializing in highly custom-built games, RPGs, and pixel art, yeah
                I make pixel art on games too.</p>
            <p> I don't just develop games, I help make and build dream ideas came into realty. I love building games
                that don't just function-I want it to feel alive and unique. Worlds and arts with personality,
                characters with charm. And mechanics that keep players coming back to the fantasy world! </p>
            <p>All projects in this site are my personal solo projects, I made everything from coding to graphics and
                designs, (and yeah including this web site) feel free to check it out.</p>
            <p>If you're building something cool, let's bring it into life!</p>
